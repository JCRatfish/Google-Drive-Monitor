Google Drive Monitor
====================

Unfortunately, Google Drive is a bit unstable at this time and is known to randomly crash, so I created Google Drive Monitor to combat this issue. This application will monitor Google Drive and restart the process (googledrivesync.exe) if the application cannot find the process running. It performs a check every 60 seconds.

You can choose to either install Google Drive Monitor or run it as a standalone application. If you chose to install Google Drive Monitor, the application will automatically start when you log in to Windows. This means you will never have to worry about your Google Drive being out of sync!
